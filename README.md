# Chris-Messa-Portfolio

## Description

This application is designed as a Portfolio for completed coding projects. The portfolio contains my personal information as well as a way to contact me, as well as a list of projects to showcase to potential employers, or anyone who would like to see my work! The portfolio project uses the following technologies:

1. HTML5

2. CSS

As well as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons used for additional styling

There are currently several changes and features I'd like to make in the future of this project:

- Remove unnecessary whitespace in the Project-1 card
- Smooth scrolling when a link is selected in the nav-bar
- More CSS animation and hover features
- Implementation of auto generating css grid items so I am able to continuously add new projects
- Finish linking the "Resume" section of the nav-bar
- Most importantly, more projects to add to the portfolio itself!

## Usage

To use the basic features of the application as it stands, one can use the deployed github pages link: <!--place link here-->
As it stands, the application simply links to the first project I have created through my coding bootcamp, as well as internally linking to other parts of the page. By clicking on the items in the nav-bar (barring the "Resume" item), the user will automatically be taken to the corresponding section on the page. When the user clicks on the "Accessibility Project" card, they will be taken to the deployed application on Github Pages.
